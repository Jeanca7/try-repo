See everybody that´s existing
Got a mind of their own
We´re all Kings and Queens
With a throne of our own
Tryin to raise a family
Is an empty home
We got to learn to stick together
Hate to be here alone
'Cause the world is a place
That will eat you alive in one day
Said the world is a place
That you can´t survive without faith
Sometimes in my tears I drown
But I never let it get me down
So when negativity surrounds
I know some day it´ll all turn around
Because
All my life I´ve been waiting for
I´ve been praying for
For the people to say
That we don´t wanna fight no more
They´ll be no more wars
And our children will play
One day (one day), One day (one day)
One day (one day), One day (one day)
One day (one day), One day (one day)
It´s not about
Win or lose
We all…

Let my right hand forget what it's supposed to do.…
